git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes
2. Run linting:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
4. Commit your changes following the commit convention

- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Running Linting

```bash
# Check for issues
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix .
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/dicton

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_config.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use pytest fixtures for shared setup
- Aim for meaningful test coverage

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass and linting is clean
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Create a pull request against `main`
4. Fill out the PR template
